## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Background

Graduating from IIT Guwahati, I have a strong hold over Machine Learning and Backend technologies. I have worked on several industry scale projects, built across different blockchains, and cloud servers. Currently, am looking to contribute to Rust-based open Source projects and serverless technology.

I have recieved Amazon AI ML scholarship , and selected into MLSS'2024 , and won multiple hackathons.

I'm currently working on building low level systems to enhance latency of data fetching from a SQL based database.
